# React Native Android Crash: Unhandled Network Request

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native applications where network request errors are not properly handled, leading to crashes on Android devices.  The issue stems from a missing or improperly implemented error handling mechanism within the `fetch` call.

## Bug Description:

The provided `bug.js` file contains a React Native component that fetches data from a remote API.  While the application correctly handles loading and displays the data successfully, it fails to gracefully handle network errors.  This results in a crash on Android when the API request fails.

## Solution:

The solution, found in `bugSolution.js`, addresses this issue by implementing comprehensive error handling within the `try...catch` block of the `useEffect` hook. This ensures that even if the `fetch` operation fails, the application doesn't crash but instead displays a user-friendly error message.
